#### What?
Wikipedia contains valuable metrics for countries around the world. I plan to capture this data and test relationships between these metrics in search of interesting insights.


#### How?
I will create a Jupyter Notebook to extract / scrape the data, store the results in a dataframe, and visualize plots to gether information.


#### Why?
This project will help develop my web scraping and analysis skills, while simultaneously working on a set of thought provoking data relevant to our modern globalized world.
